## Quick ROI Reality Check

**Ask yourself:**

- Hours/week spent on manual reporting? *(Most say: 10-20)*
- Average analyst hourly cost? *(Typically: $75-150/hour)*
- Days to get critical business insights? *(Usually: 2-5 days)*

**Conservative estimate:**  
→ **$50K+ annual savings** in efficiency alone  
→ **10x faster decisions** (real-time vs 3-day lag)  
→ **Competitive advantages** you can't easily measure

**Most clients see 2-3x this impact within 6 months.**
