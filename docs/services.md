## Pricing Philosophy

### Why I Don't Bill by the Hour  

Traditional hourly billing creates misaligned incentives:  
- You want efficiency; contractors get paid more for taking longer  
- You want strategic thinking; hourly billing rewards task execution  
- You want outcomes; hourly billing measures inputs  

### My Approach: Value-Based Pricing

I price based on:  
- The business value we're unlocking  
- The complexity of the challenge  
- The strategic importance to your organization  

This means:  
- Fixed-price projects with clear scope  
- Retainers with committed deliverables  
- Outcome-based success metrics  

**Result:** We're both incentivized toward the same goal—your success.
